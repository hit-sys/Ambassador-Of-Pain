# Ambassador-Of-Pain
Arcade Linux Game in 64 Lines of code

# Installation
Compile the source code:  
        make  
Install the binary:  
        make install  
Optionally, you can remove the executable (and other minor data)  
from the source directory by typing:  
        make clean  
Play the game!  
        aop  
          or  
        aop aop-level-1.txt .. aop-level-n.txt  
  
You are invited to design new levels and/or add nifty features as long as the resulting code is still <=64 lines!  
  
# Trivia
You may ask yourself how this rather useless code accrued. Well, here we go:  
  
Someday, Clifford told me, that long time ago, when people used to talk about their latest C64 games, the style to code was slightly different to nowaday's due to hardware restrictions. He mentioned that he programmed a game named `Power Ballon', which `Ambassador of Pain' tries to imitate, within 100 lines of code and would propably need twice of this amount to do this under modern Unix environments.  
  
One of the following days, I programmed the said game within 97 lines of code to give proof.  Clifford wouldn't be Clifford, if he didn't return me a modified version with only 64 lines, immediately. 
  
And because it's fun to play the game (isn't it?), we decided to publish it.
